# Real-time-face-blur

As per the project name, I made this project to blur the human faces in the live video feed. I did this project using OpenCV and Python.<br>
My primary purpose in creating this project is to revise the OpenCV.<br>
Download or clone this repository on your local device and run `main.py` to run this code. It will open your webcam or video device connected to your pc.
You will see that all the human faces are blurred in the output video feed.
